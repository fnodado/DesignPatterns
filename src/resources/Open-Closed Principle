Open-Closed Principle + Specification

Problem: Given that there is an existing implementation of a service. And there is a need for
an increasing number of specification in this service. For example, we have a product class with
fields name, price and category. We want to create a service to filter the specific field to the
product. By creating a condition to check each field creates a tightly coupled with specific
criteria.

Solution: Apply Specification Pattern.
Steps:
    1. Create a Specification interface and define a function to handle a condition.
    2. Create a Filter interface
    3. Create a class specific to a specification e.g(ColorSpecification, PriceSpecification,
       CategorySpecification
