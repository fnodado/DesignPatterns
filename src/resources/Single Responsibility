Single Responsibility

Problem:
    If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one part of the class may unintentionally
 affect other parts. This can lead to tightly coupled code that is hard to understand, test
 and maintain. When multiple people work on the same class for different reasons, it increases
 the risk introducing bugs.

Solution:
- one job for each class
- separation of concerns ( different classes handling different, independent
                      taks/patterns )
- a class should have a minimal responsibility
