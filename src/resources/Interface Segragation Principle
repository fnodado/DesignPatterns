Interface segregation principle - clients should not force
    to depend on interfaces that they did not use.
    - bad design , given an interface worker. A worker
    has 3 methods ( eat, sleep , work).
    - there will be an extending class called engineer that
    uses all 3 methods
    - but another extending class called lazyPerson that only
    uses 2 methods eat and sleep.
    - ISP complements decorator pattern to create smaller interfaces
    and focused to one.
    - Many specific interfaces are better than a general interface
