The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that emphasizes the
importance of designing software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) to be open for extension but closed for modification.
In simpler terms, it means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its source code.

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and the Specification Pattern are related concepts that address different aspects of software design,
but they can complement each other when designing flexible and maintainable systems.

Specification Pattern:

By creating Specification interface with 1 method signature that satisfies the requirement of feature modification.
