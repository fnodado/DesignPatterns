Solution: We need to create an interface to calculate earnings, IEarningsCalculator. We
    need to create a class for each specific category and implements the interface
    IEarningsCalculator.

    OCP will solve the concept to not modify but open for extension. We can also notice
    that there will be no compilation error.


    Specification pattern - is a design pattern to define business rules to filter criteria in
    a reusable, combinable and testable way

     Steps: we introduce 2 interfaces for open for extension pattern:
          1. Create a generic specification interface and define 1 boolean method with
          a generic parameter item.
          2. Create a filter interface with 2 parameters. 1st parameter is a list of
          generic items. 2nd parameter is generic specification.
          3. Create a specific specification class that will implement the Specification class.
          Override the boolean method and implement based on the specification.
